> I couldn't run it correctly. According to search, I found the reason and the fix method. So how can we fix it?

Due to unknown case, the maintainer don't update it with a long time. So the server get some problems.

# Start

We can archieve it on Heroku clound!

- Log in [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)

- Fork the [server sources](https://github.com/imsun/gh-oauth-server)

- Edit the package.json. Add "heroku": "NODE_ENV=production node server" in "scripts"

- Create Procfile, add web: npm run heroku, then create **app.json**, add "name": "gh-oauth-server"

- Open [heroku](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=URL), where URL is changed to a fork address e.g. github.com/USERNAME/gh-oauth-server

- Create the software. Change the original gh-oauth.imsun.net to "YourAppName".herokuapp.com

Enjoy~
